## Poem
I graduated from college.

I felt that the four years were very short.

What kind of person will I be four years from now...

## My research&production
I have researched and developed efficient data transfer protocols and applications.

I have not been able to fully implement P2P technology to improve efficiency, and I regret that.

However, I was very fortunate to have gained knowledge of TCP/IP, UDP, and encryption technologies.

I was able to receive a special award for this work.

I hope to continue to take on many challenges in the future...
